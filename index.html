                Are you tired of manually searching for Yu-Gi-Oh card names every time on the Neuron app or TCGPlayer?
                With this application, you can easily query cards with a single click and quickly get the effects of a
                card
                (when it works)!
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is an early development idea, please let me know if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions
                for
                improvements to enhance the query functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would also like to give a big thanks to YGO Pro for providing an extensive database of the most recent
                card
                information! Due to the requirements of their API, I have decided to download the entire database, and
                it
                will
                need to be manually updated.
            </p>
        </div>

    <main>
        <div class="voice-body">
            <p>
                To start, click on "Search Card" and say "card" followed by the entire card name (e.g., "card
                Blue-Eyes
                White Dragon").
                If the query is correct, an enlarged photo of the card will appear, and a voice assistant will explain
                the
                card's
                effect.
                I hope you all enjoy using this application I just thought of randomly!
