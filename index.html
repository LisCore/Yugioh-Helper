        <h2>Welcome Duelists</h2>
        <p>
            Are you tired of manually searching for Yu-Gi-Oh card names every time on the Neuron app or TCGPlayer?
            With this application, you can easily query cards with a single click and quickly get the effects of a card
            (when it works)!
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is an early development idea, please let me know if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for
            improvements to enhance the query functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also like to give a big thanks to YGO Pro for providing an extensive database of the most recent card
            information! Due to the requirements of their API, I have decided to download the entire database, and it will
            need to be manually updated.
        </p>
    </div>

    <main>
        <p>
            To start, click on "Search Card" and say "effect of" followed by the entire card name (e.g., "effect of Blue-Eyes
            White Dragon").
            If the query is correct, an enlarged photo of the card will appear, and a voice assistant will explain the card's
            effect.
            I hope you all enjoy using this application I just thought of randomly!
